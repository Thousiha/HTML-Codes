<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<section style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:larger;line-height:150%;">
<p>One of the most beloved chicken and rice dishes – the classic Yemeni Chicken Mandi. What’s not to love? Perfectly spiced succulent chicken, layered on top of glistening yellow rice and garnished with fried onions, almonds and raisins. You’ll nail it with this perfect recipe, just read the many 5-star reviews!</p>
<p>Chicken Mandi is a popular authentic Yemeni dish that consists of 3 components: chicken (or any other meat), a Yemeni spice mix called “Hawaij”, and rice. Sounds like a simple dish, right? Wrong! Because the authenticity is all in the cooking method! Mandi is traditionally slow cooked in an underground “oven”, called a Taboon. It’s basically like a big hole with lots of coal inside, and the chicken and rice are cooked inside, with the chicken on a rack on top of the rice so all the juices can drip into the pot.</p>
<p>Because it slow cooks on coals, it inherits a delicious smoky flavour. And because it takes a while to make it, its usually only served at special occasions and celebrations.</p>

<h3>Notes on the Ingredients for Chicken Mandi</h3>
<ul style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size:larger;line-height:150%;">
<li>Rice; I use long grain basmati for the best results</li>
<li>Onions; definitely use white onions and slice them evenly. These are key!</li>
<li>Chicken; I like to use bone-in full chicken legs. Using bone in chicken keeps it really tender and juicy. I don’t recommend you use breast for this recipe.</li>
<li>The Hawaij spice blend</li>
<li>Bay leaves; these are optional but add a lovely aroma</li>
<li>Dry lime; find these at your local middle eastern store. If you really can’t find them you can skip them but they add a deep earthy citrusy flavour that can’t be replicated with any other ingredient</li>
<li>Saffron; just a small amount will go a long way. They add to the yellow pigment and also give a beautiful taste and aroma. But saffron is expensive so if you don’t have it feel free to skip it.</li>
<li>Almonds and Raisins; for that final touch in the form of garnish!</li>
</ul>

<li>Make the Hawaij spice blend so the chicken can have time to marinate. Place all the spices (except for the turmeric and bay leaves) into a pan and toast them for 2-3 minutes on medium high until you start to smell them. Keep an eye out because they burn quickly (I burned my first batch sadly).</li>
<li>Now you can remove two teaspoons of the spice mix and set aside for the rice, then use the remaining for the chicken. Mix it with the turmeric and salt, then add the olive oil to create a paste. Slather it all over the chicken and marinate overnight for maximum flavour. But a few hours is fine too.</li>
<li>When you are ready to start making the dish, thinly slice the onions ensuring you slice as evenly as possible. You can use a mandolin if you have one. Even sizes help them fry evenly.</li>
<li>In a pot, add the oil and then drop in the onions while oil is still cold. Fry for 15-20 minutes, stirring them around every few minutes.</li>
<li>Since we are not deep frying, they won’t get extremely crunchy, but that’s totally fine. This is the simplest method I found that allows you to use all the onion infused oil in your rice.</li>
<li>Once the onions are golden brown, remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels, but leave approximately 3 tablespoons in the pot (to be used for the rice). Be sure to spread them out in one layer to give them a chance to crisp up.</li>
<li>Now its time to make the rice broth. Keep frying up the onions in the oil, in the same pot, and add the hawaij spice blend, and the dried lime. Before you add the dried lime, pierce them a couple of times with a knife (very carefully).
Once the spices are toasted, add the bay leaves and the water and bring to a boil
</li>
<li>Now its time to strain the broth that was used to steam the chicken. Reserve the liquid and measure it out to exactly 1.5 cups of liquid to 1 cup of rice. Add water to the broth if needed.</li>
<li>Add the strained broth back into the same pot, then add the turmeric, the bloomed saffron and the salt.Next add the washed and soaked rice (soaking for only 10 minutes), give it a good mix, then bring the pot to a boil</li>
<li>Cook the rice for 20 minutes undisturbed. Then turn the heat off, fluff with a fork, then cover and let stand for another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>While the rice cooks, quickly fry the almonds and the raisins in a bit of olive oil to toast them.Remove the beautifully golden chicken from the oven and you are ready to assemble!</li>
