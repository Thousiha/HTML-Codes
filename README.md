# HTML Coding Tasks for Web Development

This repository contains a series of HTML coding tasks that focus on building different web components using semantic HTML tags. Each task is designed to help you understand and practice HTML structure, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## Tasks

### 1. **Company Landing Page (Semantic Structure)**
A startup needs a basic landing page with a clearly defined header, navigation, main content area, and footer. 

- Use semantic tags: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`.
- Include a prominent headline, subheadline, and a short description of the startup’s mission.

### 2. **Recipe Article with Sections**
A food blogger needs a single-page layout for a recipe post.

- Use `<article>` to wrap the recipe’s introduction, ingredients, and steps.
- Organize ingredients in an unordered list (`<ul>`) and instructions in an ordered list (`<ol>`).

### 3. **Event Registration Form**
Collect user details for an upcoming workshop.

- Create a form (`<form>`) with `<label>` and `<input>` for name, email, and phone.
- Add a dropdown (`<select>`) for session preference (e.g., Morning or Afternoon) and checkboxes for terms & conditions.

### 4. **Team Bio Page**
A marketing website needs a simple “Meet the Team” page.

- Use headings, subheadings, and paragraphs for each team member’s name, role, and bio.
- Optionally include headshots using `<figure>` or simple `<img>` tags.

### 5. **Pricing Table**
A client sells subscription plans and wants a clean pricing table.

- Construct a table (`<table>`) with `<thead>` for column headers (Plan, Price, Features) and `<tbody>` for rows.
- Use `<th>` for column headers and `<td>` for plan details.

### 6. **Media Embeds**
A tutorial site requires an instructional video and audio snippet.

- Insert an HTML5 `<video>` with controls and a poster image.
- Embed an `<audio>` element with controls for a short language-learning snippet.

### 7. **Image Gallery with Captions**
A photography portfolio needs a simple gallery layout.

- Wrap each photo in a `<figure>` with a `<figcaption>` describing the image.
- Include alt text for accessibility.

### 8. **Contact Page with Social Links**
A corporate website wants a dedicated contact page.

- Provide a short paragraph about how to reach the company.
- Include links (`<a>`) to social media profiles (absolute links) and an email link (`mailto:`).

### 9. **SEO & Meta Tags**
A newly launched service wants improved SEO.

- In the `<head>`, add `<title>`, `<meta name="description" content="...">`, `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, and `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`.
- Briefly comment how these tags help SEO and responsiveness.

### 10. **Multi-Page Website Structure**
A small site with three pages (Home, Services, Contact) needs consistent navigation.

- Create `home.html`, `services.html`, and `contact.html`, each with a similar header and footer.
- Link pages together with `<nav>` and relative paths (`href="services.html"`).
